# Thin bootstrap that puts PWNSAT-C3-Release/pwnsat_tools on sys.path and
# re-exports the packet-building functions attack scripts need, instead of
# duplicating any SPP/CCSDS or AES-ECB logic here. This repo already has one
# place that builds a byte-exact telecommand for every APID
# (usb_tc_send.py's build_wire_payload/build_logical_payload +
# spp_tools.py's build_tc) -- reuse it, don't re-derive per-APID layouts.
#
# Deliberately does NOT import backend/command_registry.py: that module is
# tied to the FastAPI app's `settings` (session secrets, login defaults),
# irrelevant to a standalone attack script. This goes one layer lower,
# straight to pwnsat_tools, which has no such dependency.

    carries the raw SPP packet as its payload directly, confirmed by
    gradio/pwnsat_lora_rx.py's ZMQ sink publishing lora_rx's output
    unwrapped).

    Example -- RESETC, no payload, encrypted:
        build_command_packet("reset", seq=1)

    Example -- SET_THRUSTER, thruster 0 to power 200, encrypted:
        build_command_packet("thruster", seq=1, thruster_id=0, power=200)
