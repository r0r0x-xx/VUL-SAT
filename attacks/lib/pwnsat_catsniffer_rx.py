# CatSniffer v2 (Electronic Cats, SX1262 onboard) as a dedicated, always-on
# LoRa downlink listener.
#
# Why this exists: a single HackRF cannot reliably catch the FlatSat's
# downlink reply -- it answers in ~11ms (measured on the firmware's debug
# console), faster than a half-duplex SDR can close an uplink
# `hackrf_transfer -t` and reopen `hackrf_transfer -r` (100ms+ of
# USB/device-reinit overhead, a deterministic hardware limit, not RF noise).
# A second dedicated radio removes the race: this module keeps the
# CatSniffer in RX continuously while HackRF (pwnsat_lora_tx.py) stays
# TX-only, so there's no window to miss.
#
# The CatSniffer already had Electronic Cats' "LoRa Sniffer CLI 0.1"
# firmware flashed -- no firmware work needed; this module only drives its
# serial CLI (115200 8N1). Its defaults (SF7, CR 4/5, sync word 0x12,
# preamble 8) matched New-firmware/rdownlink.h out of the box; only
# frequency (915.0 -> 916.0) and bandwidth (125 -> 250, index 8 in this
# firmware's set_bw table, confirmed by hand) needed changing.
