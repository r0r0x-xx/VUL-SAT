# RTL-SDR as a dedicated, always-on LoRa downlink listener -- fallback for
# 00_recon_apid_enum when a CatSniffer isn't available.
#
# Why this exists: pwnsat_catsniffer_rx.py was built first (see its docstring
# for the TX/RX-turnaround diagnosis), but both CatSniffers on hand this
# session were hardware-faulty (stopped enumerating on USB, invisible to
# `ioreg` -- not a software problem). The RTL-SDR normally dedicated to
# PWNSAT-C3's own downlink view is the only other receive-capable radio on
# hand, so C3 is stopped and its RTL-SDR borrowed for 00's RX. Same idea as
# the CatSniffer: a second dedicated radio removes the single-HackRF TX/RX
# turnaround race, since it never switches modes.
#
# Reuses PwnsatLoraRX (the same live GNU Radio + SoapySDR flowgraph
# 01_eavesdropping/pwnsat_lora_rx.py and the C3 bridge use for RTL-SDR
# downlink) instead of duplicating the SoapySDR/gain handling -- imported,
# not copied. Runs it continuously, publishing to a LOCAL loopback ZMQ
# address (not C3's 5005/5006), with a SUB socket in this process to recover
# decoded frames -- same frame-boundary mechanism the eavesdropping tool and
# pwnsat_lora_rx_capture.py rely on.
