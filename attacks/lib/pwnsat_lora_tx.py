# HackRF LoRa transmitter for the DEFCON-DEMO attack scripts. Sibling of

# encoding blocks, mirror image (TX instead of RX), but NOT a live GNU Radio
# flowgraph streaming to the radio the way the RX side is. Read on for why.
#
# NOTE: must run under a Python with `gnuradio` and `gnuradio.lora_sdr`

# Radio parameters below (918 MHz uplink, BW 250 kHz, SF7, CR 4/5, sync word
# 0x12, explicit header, PHY CRC disabled) are copied from
# New-firmware/ruplink.cpp's uplinkRadioConfigure(). Get any wrong and the
# SX1262 never sees the packet.
#
# Why this renders to a file and shells out to hackrf_transfer instead of
# streaming live through a GNU Radio soapy.sink: on-air debugging found the
# live soapy.sink -> HackRF path does not reproduce a correct LoRa chirp,
# even after fixing two real bugs (AMP gain never enabled; a message_strobe
# that doesn't fire until a full period elapses). The same block chain
# captured to a FILE produced textbook-correct LoRa baseband (8 clean
# up-chirps -BW/2 to +BW/2, then sync-word symbols), and hackrf_transfer
# replaying that file reproduced the same clean chirp on air. Conclusion:
# gr-lora_sdr's encoding is correct; something in GNU Radio's live
# SoapySDR-sink streaming (never fully root-caused) corrupts it. So this
# module keeps all LoRa correctness in gr-lora_sdr and only changes how it
# reaches the antenna.

    Feeds whitening over its STREAM input (is_hex=True), not its message
    port. Confirmed this session that the message port corrupts any byte
    >=0x7F: whitening's message handler calls pmt_symbol_to_string()
    internally and something downstream of that re-encodes the result as
    UTF-8, silently turning one high-value byte into two bytes -- caught
    by comparing a real FlatSat serial log against this module's own
    known ciphertext and finding every byte >=0x80 replaced by its exact
    2-byte UTF-8 encoding (e.g. real byte 0xF7 arriving as the two bytes
    C3 B7). A raw PDU (dict, u8vector) isn't a fix either -- whitening's
    message port rejects it outright ("wrong_type" from
    pmt_symbol_to_string, it unconditionally expects a plain symbol).
    Hex digits over the stream port are pure 7-bit ASCII, so there is no
    string/encoding step in this path at all: nothing to mangle.

    The block chain itself (header -> add_crc -> hamming_enc ->
    interleaver -> gray_demap -> modulate) is unchanged and was proven
    correct in isolation this session: captured straight from this chain,
    the preamble is 8 identical, cleanly swept up-chirps exactly where
    the LoRa spec says they should be, at both 1x and 8x oversampling.
